            <p>by ~habsul-rignyr</p>
            <h3>The Plan</h3>
            <p>
              The Urbit Foundation's current timeline places it on a trajectory
              to formally separate from Tlon in early 2022. According to Josh
              Lehman (speaking in a recent Developer Call), paperwork has just
              been filed to start the process of forming in the Caymans
              following months of research by Tlon COO Erik Newton. Next steps
              are to put the plan before the Galactic Senate and present them
              with a budget for the next few years of operation.
            </p>
            <h3>Foundation as a Protocol</h3>
            <p>
              The current incarnation of the Foundation is as a protocol.
              According to Josh Lehman, this has involved trying to use grants
              to get things done while keeping overhead low by remaining a part
              of Tlon. The end goal was to eventually to take over core dev.
              During this phase, the approach was to work closely with
              contributors. Valuable lessons were learned, including that
              initial project specification makes or breaks projects.
              Furthermore, the Urbit community tends to pull in very
              high-quality contributors, and the grants program seems to be a
              good way to recruit them.
            </p>

            <h3>From Protocol to Entity</h3>
            <p>
              With Josh as the Executive Director, the Galactic Senate will be
              tasked with selecting board members. The foundation will get
              assets on Senate approval subsequent to a 2-year budget proposal.
              Outcomes will be assessed by the Senate, who will continue to
              provide feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Going Forward</h3>
            <p>
              The picture of how the Foundation will operate in the future is
              twofold: as coordinator and investor. On the coordination side, UF
              will coordinate people and orgs developing on Urbit. This will be
              realized through ongoing documentation and course-building. Grants
              will be community driven, based upon proposals. As a proposal is
              made, "champions" can come forward to select proposals to work on.
              Champions will be drawn from the pool of people who have previous
              Urbit dev experience. Grants, therefore, will be proposed and
              built by a DAO-like entity of existing contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
              As investor, the Foundation is potentially paying "champions" and
              their teams in grants, which going forward may indeed be funded by
              wrapped Stars, as the price of stars has made single-unit rewards
              less likely. But the big news here is the formation of The
              Combine, currently being formed by ~poldec-tonteg, to invest in
              early stage organizations. The model here expands on the model of
              Tlon itself, in which the Foundation seeks, through The Combine,
              to do "Digital Real Estate Investment".
            </p>
            <p>
              To bring the meta-mission of UF into focus, it is to "coordinate
              and foster a growing decentralized ecosystem".
            </p>
            <h3>Additional questions</h3>
            <p>
              UF Preferred projects? Networked apps, apps that focus on
              coordination and comms. According to Josh, those that require file
              storage are not yet good candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initial funding size from The Combine? In the range of $100-200k.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plans to replace Hooniversity? Asynchronous written docs,
              expansion of Hoon School, and bringing old guides (like the Gall
              Guide) up to date. Also some support for and reliance on the
              community, where members like Niel Davis have been expanding
              offerings.
