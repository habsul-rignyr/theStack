Cenotaph is an engraved-style titling face which draws reference from inscriptions done by Eric Gill - most notably in the vertical stem in the 'U'. In OpenType format it contains 10 discretionary ligatures useful for stylistic and practical spacing purposes, as well as 3 alternate ampersands and proportional old style numerals. This first iteration of the typeface is free for personal and commercial use.
