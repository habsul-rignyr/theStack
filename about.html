            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This is the Orbis Legder, a site for Urbit news and lifestyle.
              It’s operated by ~habsul-rignyr, who has written all the code
              without bothering to go the usual route of first being a coder.
              Therefore, let any success in the arousal of general interest
              redound to the Urbit community, whose boundless creativity and
              competence we herein chronicle. But if the reader finds that the
              CSS appears to have been written by a man trying badly to organize
              his morning porridge, place the blame squarely with your humble
              servant, H. Rignyr, Esq. As the Urbit Precepts remind us: “Not
              being qualified to solve a problem is no reason not to solve it.”
            </p>

            <p>
              The problem this site is meant to solve is that its author found
              himself putting his nose into every corner of Urbit and had become
              something of an aggregator of events and information on one of
              those Old World social media hell sites. The Urbit Foundation has
              its writers, but while the Foundation creates news, it is does not
              have a news organ. Neither does it have an organ for the creation
              of long-form Urbit think-posts (though it can and has tapped its
              brain trust for just this, on occasion) or New Urbit City travel
              guides, or Urbit Review of Books, or Urbit Finance, or any other
              Urbit-flavored media not immediately necessary to some purpose
              (rather than cooked in the febrile imaginings of one Hon. H.
              Rignyr, Esq.).
            </p>

            <h3>The Current State and the Future Product</h3>

            <p>
              Currently, The Orbis Ledger is a static site being hosted on a VPS
              out of Singapore. Singapore is the place previously best known for
              Lee Kuan Yew and the Marina Bay Skyline. Naturally, we think The
              Orbis Ledger is the first thing people should think of when they
              think of that little island country, and encourage Urbiters to
              respond to any mention of it thus: “Singapore? Yes, wonderful
              place. Have the good luck to publish the Ledger.” Next steps in
              the evolution of the site are:

              <ul><li>conversion to a proper PERN stack app</li>
            
            <li>Urbit Visor integration</li>
            <li>additional bells, whistles, Calm Engine Standards Compliance</li>
            <li>eventual hosting on an Urbit backend</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>What about The三Stack Podcast?</h3>
            <p>We (~libhut-samwes and ~habsul-rignyr) will continue the podcast and it will remain free forever even if we eventually find a way to make it make money.  It will become a part of the de facto Urbit News Network along with The Orbis Ledger, which is itself a step up in this impromptu hierarchy.  As a token of our esteem for him, Mr. Samwes will continue to be paid by UNN twice what he is worth.
            </p>
